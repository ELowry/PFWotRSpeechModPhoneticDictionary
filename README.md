This is a customized variant of the [phonetic dictionary file for the Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous SpeechMod created by Valdacil](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/898).

I have modified it in order to:
- Function with both en.US and en.UK "natural" voices.
  - *Note: because of this, some words are not quite perfect, especially in terms of "rythm"; but they should be close enough not to be distracting.*
- Better fit my personal pronounciation preferences (North-Western USA pronounciation for the most part).
